                            Implemented a wide range of web development tools and frameworks. My most familar is with React and Next.js. These frameworks allow for more efficient implementation of javascript, html and css. 
                            These frameworks would not be possible with Node.js and NPM, the node package manager. The package manager allows developers to access a wide variety of code libraries just by importing them into your project and call upon to use their functions.

                            User experience and design is something I'm very keen on. It is important to identify from the users point of view. Navigation should be easy and intuitive, ideally without any instruction manual. To task, I ask several questions to get better ideas of what a user is experiencing while using a template. The changes would be made upon a set of feedback where common issues are experienced. I use several tools to draft amazing designs. These range from sketching, outlining, experimenting and assembling designs. Some of the tools I use in combination are Photoshop and it's alternatives custom designs on logos and vector graphics. For outlining and simulating user experience flow I use Figma or Adobe XD.

                        <p className="text-sm font-normal">
                            Realistically, these go hand in hand. Without communication, there is no effective team or teamwork. Collaboration is almost a kind of art. Certain hues work well together when achieving a specific feel. Warm colors ilicit a certain feeling opposite of colder colors. Depending on what the team aims to achieve, it is important to establish a goal or milestones to work towards. If the goal was to create a warm feel, it is important to say to eachother to use red, yellow and orange. Communication establishes a common path so that those within the team are in sync. Without it, it is difficult to achieve an expected result. I always like to make sure to check with team or client to get feedback.
